# Contact Tracer Analytics

*This is my final project for UCLA's CS 205 Health Analytics course.*

## Introduction

Contact Tracer is a contact tracing system designed to combat the transmission of infectious diseases and pandemics. Contact Tracer is designed to assist traditional contact tracing by automatically logging an individual's contacts by detecting them via Bluetooth signals. Data is stored securely on a users device and is shared only where the user grants explicit permission.

Contact Tracer is divided into two parts: 
- iOS App
- Analytics.

This repository covers Analytics. You can view the iOS App [here](https://github.com/thomascpan/contact-tracer).

## Description

Contact Tracer Analytics is the backend system that stores and analyzes user provided data. This project contains a jupyter notebook that demonstrates some of the data analytics that can be conducted and utilized to combat infectious diseases. 

## Instructions

Before running the notebook, please download the dataset from Kaggle  and save into "data" directory inside project.
