    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact Tracer is a contact tracing system designed to combat the transmission of infectious diseases and pandemics. Contact Tracer is designed to assist traditional contact tracing by automatically logging an individual's contacts by detecting them via Bluetooth signals. Data is stored securely on a users device and is shared only where the user grants explicit permission. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Welcome](img/welcome.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact Tracer is easy to use. Just sign up and leave the app on. It will automatically record nearby devices with the contact tracer installed. \n",

    "#### Contact Tracing\n",
    "The process of identification of persons who may have come into contact with an infected person (\"contacts\") and subsequent collection of further information about these contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "- Interrupt ongoing transmission and reduce spread of an infection\n",
    "- Alert contacts to the possibility of infection and offer preventive counseling or prophylactic care\n",
    "- Offer diagnosis, counseling and treatment to already infected individuals\n",
    "- Help prevent reinfection\n",
    "- Learn about the epidemiology of a disease in a particular population\n"

    "\n",
    "Due to lack of organically gathered daa, we utilize data from NYC MTA buses service. [Source](https://www.google.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate our data, we transform their GPS logs over a 7 day period into a log of contacts. We log all instances in which two buses are located within a certain amount of distance of each other for a given time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Stats\n",
    "- Individuals(Buses): 5719\n",
    "- Days: 7\n",
    "- Logs: 248900\n",

    "## Code and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user's contacts are synced to Contact Tracer's backend, it essentially formed a network of individuals and their contacts. Here the nodes are individuals, and the edges represent who an individual has come into contact during a certain time period. With our contacts collected, we can now perform a variety of analytics. Here we demonstrate two examples: Connected Components(CC) and Ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connected Components\n",
    "\n",
    "For CC, we are simply interested in finding a subgraph in which any two contacts are connected to each other. Although simple, this is perhaps, the most important analysis to perform. When an infected person is identified, a CC indentifies all the individuals who may have come into contact with the infected person and who may be potentially infected themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "For Ranking, we are interested in assigning a rank or priority to individuals. A rank, in this case, can be thought of their potential to transmit a disease. As such, public health authorities should contact high ranked individuals first to mitigate the spread of a virus."

Having created a network, we can now perform useful analysis such as identifying Connected Components to see where a virus may have spread and Ranking, where we can quantify the importance and potential for a person to spread a disease so that we may proritize contacting those individuals.
